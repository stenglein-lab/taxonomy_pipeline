### Conda environment for pipeline dependencies

The yaml file in this directory defines a conda environment that includes the dependencies needed by this pipeline.  Nextflow will use this definition file to create an all-in-one conda environment that it will use to run the pipeline (if you execute nextflow run with `-profile conda`)
