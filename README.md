## Stenglein lab taxonomic assessment pipeline


This is a nextflow implementation of the pipeline used in the [Stenglein lab](http://www.stengleinlab.org) to taxonomically classify sequences in NGS datasets.

This pipeline has been reported in a number of [publications](https://www.stengleinlab.org/papers/) from our lab.


**Note that the following documentation refers to the main repository branch bash version of the pipeline.  Documentation for this new nextflow version is pending:**

For information on how to run this pipeline, please read [this tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md)
